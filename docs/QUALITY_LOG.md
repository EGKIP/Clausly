# Quality Log

Daily autonomous quality/maintenance runs for Clausly. Newest entries at the bottom. Entries are not rewritten after the fact.

## 2026-09-03

### Quality Gates
- Build: pass
- Typecheck: pass (`tsc --noEmit`)
- Lint: pass (`next lint`, no warnings)
- Unit tests: pass (524/524, 97 files, vitest)
- E2E: none configured (no Playwright in this repo yet)

### Issues Found
- **P3 (hardening):** Supabase security advisor flagged mutable `search_path` on `public.set_updated_at`, `public.match_document_chunks`, `public.match_portfolio_chunks`. Not exploitable today (no unqualified/shadowable references in their bodies), but pinning `search_path` is standard defense-in-depth.
- **P3 (hardening):** `public.handle_new_user()` (the `on_auth_user_created` trigger function) was directly executable via PostgREST RPC by `anon`/`authenticated`. Calling it outside trigger context errors out (`NEW` is unset), so not exploitable, but the grant was unnecessary surface.
- **P4 (info, no code fix):** `auth_leaked_password_protection` is disabled in Supabase Auth settings. This is a dashboard/account setting, not a migration — recommend the owner enable it in Supabase Auth → Policies.
- **P4 (info, no code fix):** `vector` extension is installed in the `public` schema rather than a dedicated schema. Low risk; moving it is a nontrivial migration (every `vector` column/type reference would need re-qualifying) and not worth the churn right now.
- Reviewed `sendWelcomeEmailOnceForUser` (`src/lib/notifications/welcome.ts`): read-then-write idempotency check has a narrow race if the auth callback fires twice concurrently (e.g. duplicate navigation to `/auth/callback`), which could send two welcome emails. Sequential idempotency is tested; concurrent idempotency is not. Judged P4/cosmetic (duplicate transactional email, no data or security impact) — not fixed today to avoid changing failure-handling semantics without a stronger justification. Documented for a future pass if it recurs in practice.

### Fixes Completed
- Added `supabase/migrations/20260903000100_harden_function_search_path.sql`: pins `search_path = public` on `set_updated_at`, `match_document_chunks`, `match_portfolio_chunks`, and revokes the unused public/anon/authenticated execute grants on `handle_new_user`. Pure `ALTER FUNCTION`/`REVOKE` statements — no behavior change, not yet applied to the live database (ships through the normal migration/deploy path).

### Tests Added/Changed
- None. The migration has no application-code surface to unit test; correctness was verified by re-reading the live function bodies via Supabase's read-only advisor/schema tools against `clausly-prod` (no writes made to the database in this session).

### Remaining Concerns
- No P0/P1 issues found. Auth, document upload/analysis, reminders, and tenant-isolation flows all have passing regression coverage (see `tests/integration/rls-isolation.test.ts` for cross-user isolation).
- No E2E/browser test harness exists yet (no Playwright config, no live Supabase credentials in this environment) — UI flows were verified by reading route/component code and existing component tests, not by driving a live browser. Adding Playwright is a reasonable future investment given the app is otherwise stable.
- Owner action recommended (not code): enable leaked-password protection in Supabase Auth settings for `clausly-prod`.
